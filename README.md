# Finance-Chatbot

#### Project Description:

The Finance Chatbot is a cutting-edge application designed to provide users with personalized financial assistance and insights. The system enables dynamic and context-aware interactions using the LangChain library for natural language processing. It employs the Generative AI model "Gemini 1.0 Pro," which provides precise and insightful answers. By utilizing advanced text embeddings, known as "Google Text Embeddings 004," the system enhances user engagement and semantic comprehension. 

To ensure rapid access to relevant financial data, it uses the "AstraDB" vector database for efficient data storage and retrieval. The backend is built on the "Flask" framework, which provides a robust API for managing data and processing requests. Additionally, the dynamic 'Streamlit' user interface allows users to easily interact with the chatbot. With deployment on "Amazon EC2," the system guarantees scalability, reliability, and secure access.
